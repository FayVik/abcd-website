                    <p className="md:pr-20">Cardano Starter Kits (CSKs) are open source, Project Based Learning (PBL) opportunities for people to engage with Cardano in the real world, and to learn through experience what the Cardano platform can doÙè∞â CSKs consist of smart contract code, voting apparatus, guided learning materials, and implementation tips. CSKs will support users to learn about Cardano while also producing real-world outcomes, and will vary in complexity, for everyone from beginners to experts. CSKs will not be "grab and go", but are grounded in the understanding that we learn best by doing experiential learning. Anyone who is interested will be able to build upon open source CSKs to start local businesses and to host local events that drive hands-on understanding of Cardano.</p>
